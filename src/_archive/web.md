## Decentralized Web

With an "online digital self" representing you, putting you in the center of everything digital, you can step away from being the product for traditional web services.  Traditional web services are centralized applications that provide a single set of functionality, owned by a single (monopolistic) organization who is competing for your attention and wants to keep you in their walled garden collecting data about you to monetize. 

With the digital self in the center we can reverse that model and make the digital self a "platform of capabilities" that provides you with web services.  For example digital selves can find other digital selves in a "phonebook" like manner where it would be fairly straightforward to send messages between two digital selves, wouldn't it?  No need any more to have an "email" provider (a third party that sits in the middle), or an instant message provider (same story).  All that messaging (be it text, voice of video) can be created and delivered to the other digital self.

A similar thing is true for other web applications.  For a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system you just install the application on your digital self "platform" and host your own application with your own private storage and retrieval of data plus allowing other (digital selves) to to access and share you data.  Simple, right? 

ThreeFold now is working on a growing set of decentralized web services for you to take forward.  The current list of services being worked on is listed on the menu on the left, categorized.
