3) Harmony on ThreeFold: 
Serving Harmony and its validator node community with 1-Click deployments and cloud-native developer tools. 
 

 
	About Harmony: 
Harmony is a fast and open blockchain for decentralized applications. Its protocol has achieved secure and random state sharding, being the first sharded Proof of Stake on production. Harmony's Mainnet supports thousands of nodes in multiple shards, producing blocks in a few seconds with instant finality. The network's staking mechanism reduces centralization while supporting stake delegation, reward compounding and double-sign slashing. Harmony aims to build an open network of nodes operated and governed by a large community. Harmony has designed a novel Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism for network security and economics - Effective Proof-of-Stake (EPoS) which reduces centralization and distributes rewards fairly to thousands of validators.
	Harmony & ThreeFold:  
Harmony.one and ThreeFold joined forces to provide a performant, decentralized and customizable solution that enables to easily and cost-effectively deploy and run a Harmony validator node ( or many) and access the growing staking ecosystem of Harmony's Blokchain. 
With the ThreeFold P2P cloud and its developer tools - 3bot admin panel, the ThreeFold SDK - Harmony empowers its expanding community with a 1 click validator node deployments, directly from the web or from a local machine, giving its node operators control over their containerized Validator nodes, and a more efficient way to spin them up on a decentralized IT infrastructure. 
By Leveraging ThreeFold's decentralized storage, compute, and networking, as well as its compatibility with Docker, Kubernetes ​​​​​​​, S3 storage, containerized Databases, and other open-source software, Harmony's developer community unlocked an additional alternative to centralized cloud providers, with the ability to build highly scalable cloud-native and Blockchain based applications and deploy them close to where their users are.
- Get started with Harmony: 
	Deploy harmony validator nodes in a few clicks: https://forum.threefold.io/t/setting-up-a-harmony-node-on-the-threefold-grid/476 ( should we link to it to this tuto? )
	Build and deploy Harmony dApps using TheeFold’s P2P compute and storage ( Read the docs, install the SDK, Reach out to us : TO BE DETAILED)
