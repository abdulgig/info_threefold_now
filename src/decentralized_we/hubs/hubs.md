### Taking collaboration to the next level

Just like with video conferencing the recent pandemic has changed the way we collaborate and work together a lot.  Video conferencing is a much more accepted way to work then lets say 2 years ago and as proof of that there has been an incredible increase in online schooling and family reunions/parties.  Similar to that the ThreeFold Foundation expects that online collaboration in virtual co-create spaces will take a flight and tooling is needed to create online spaces for that. Online collaboration to experience are up and coming.

Mozilla Hubs is a virtual collaboration platform that runs in a browser. With Hubs you can create your own 3D spaces with a single click. Invite others to join using a URL, while no installation or app store is required.

Hubs is for anyone who wants to connect with others remotely! It's a great way to bring communities together in a shared virtual space.Host a conference, teach a class, showcase art, or just hang out with friends. Hubs makes it easy to connect and share images, videos, 3D models, and more. With Hubs' spatialized audio you can have conversations with everyone together or break out into smaller groups â€” just like you can in in the physical world. Hubs works across platforms. Got a VR headset? Awesome! If not, you can use your desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or mobile devices to explore in 2D.

Hubs is open source and customizable. Upload personalized avatars or create unique environments using Spoke. For more documentation please go [here](https://hubs.mozilla.com/docs/hubs-cloud-getting-started.html)

### Hubs on the ThreeFold grid

Today Hubs cloud is available on centralized hosters that present a cloud platform solution. Alternatively you can invest effort to understand how a private instance of hubs needs to be deployed on dedicated hardware and run it in your own environment.  The TF Grid offers solutions where you can either rent capacity anywhere on the TF Grid (please find the [explorer](https://explorer.grid.tf/) here) and deploy, or even take the step of creating your own TF Grid capacity, earn some digital currency by doing so and have your own hosted infrastructure for you digital hubs where you feel comfortable of locating it.
