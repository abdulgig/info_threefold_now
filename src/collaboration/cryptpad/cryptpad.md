# Cryptpad

CryptPad is a private-by-design alternative to popular office tools and cloud services. All the content stored on CryptPad is encrypted before being sent, which means nobody can access your data unless you give them the keys (not even us).

The ThreeFold team uses it for internal documents and collaboration, and now so can end-users on the ThreeFold Grid.
